# Hate-Speech-Detection
The increasing use of social media and information sharing has given major benefits to humanity. However, this has also given rise to a variety of challenges including the spreading and sharing of hate speech messages. Thus, to solve this emerging issue in social media sites, recent studies employed a variety of feature engineering techniques and machine learning algorithms to automatically detect the hate speech messages on different datasets. 
However,  there is no study to compare the variety of feature engineering techniques and machine learning algorithms to evaluate which feature engineering technique and machine learning algorithm outperform on a standard publicly available dataset. Hence, the aim of this project is to compare the performance of three feature engineering techniques and four machine learning algorithms to evaluate their performance on a publicly available dataset having three distinct classes.
